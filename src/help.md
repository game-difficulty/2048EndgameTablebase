# 3. Concepts

## 3.1 What is an Endgame?

An endgame starts from a specific setup where some large numbers are already placed in certain tiles, and the player must use the remaining spaces to merge numbers and achieve a target number, thus advancing the game. **An endgame refers to the entire process of reaching the target number from a specific setup.**

## 3.2 Classification of Endgames

**Endgames are classified based on the number of remaining tiles and the difficulty of the endgame.**

For example, a 10-space 16k endgame (16384 endgame) refers to a setup where large numbers such as 8k, 4k, 2k, 1k, 512, and 256 are already placed in 6 tiles. The remaining 10 spaces need to form a 256, which is considered a "16k difficulty".

Similarly, a 12-space 32k endgame (32768 endgame) means that 16k, 8k, 4k, and 2k are already placed, and the remaining 12 spaces must form 2048 to eventually reach 32768.

If the setup already contains 32k, 16k, 4k, and 2k, and the player needs to use 12 empty spaces to form 2048, it is still considered a 12-space 32k endgame because this process is equivalent to forming a 32768.

Therefore, the classification of an endgame only depends on how many large numbers are in the setup, not which specific large numbers are present.

Question: What is the target number for a 9-space 65k endgame?

## 3.3 What is a Formation?

**A formation is an endgame with additional constraints.**

In the game, it is generally better to keep the large numbers stationary, while the target number must be formed at specific positions to maintain the formation. Therefore, the constraints usually include:
- The large numbers in the initial setup must stay in place or can only move in limited ways.
- The target number must be formed at specified positions.

If no constraints are added to the endgame, it is called a **free formation**.

## 3.4 Classification of Formations

Formations are classified based on the initial setup, constraints, and target number (endgame difficulty). Detailed classifications can be found in the appendix.

## 6.1 Formation Calculation Parameters and Options

### Formation Calculation Parameters

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pattern**    | Formation name                                                                                                         |
| **Target**     | Target number                                                                                                          |
| **Position**   | The position where the target number should be formed. <br/> Only a few pattern support this option, usually set to 0. |

### Advanced Options

| Button                                      | Function                                          | Purpose                              |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Compress Temp Files**                     | Compress all intermediate files                   | Reduce disk usage during calculation |
| **Compress**                                | Compress the final .book files                    | Reduce final disk usage              |
| **Opt Only**                                | Keep only the optimal branches                    | Reduce final disk usage              |
| **Remove Boards with a Success Rate Below** | Remove boards with success rate below a threshold | Reduce final disk usage              |

**Note**:
- All of the above options **do not** affect the accuracy of the success rates.
- The **"Remove Boards with a Success Rate Below"** and **"Opt Only"** options will delete some boards (usually unreasonable ones) and display a success rate of 0, but **will not** affect other data.

### Advanced Algorithm Option  
When **Advanced Algo** is checked, the program will adopt an advanced algorithm. Tiles ≥64 and <32k are defined as *large numbers*, and those ≤32 as *small numbers*. 
The algorithm will prune positions that do not meet the following conditions:   

1. **Large number combinations**:  
   a. Except for the smallest large number, all other large numbers may exist at most once.  
   b. If the smallest large number is >64, it may exist at most twice.  
   c. If the smallest large number is 64, it may exist at most three times.  
   Examples: Valid combinations (4k 2k 512 128 128), (1k 512 256), (512 64 64 64); Invalid combinations (4k 2k 512 128 128 128), (4k 2k 512 128 128 64).  

2. **Sum of small numbers**:  
  Controlled by the hyperparameter **SmallTileSumLimit (stsl)**:  
   a. Sum of small numbers ≤ stsl + 64  
   b. If the board contains two identical large numbers: sum of small numbers ≤ stsl  
   c. If the board contains three 64s: sum of small numbers ≤ stsl - 64  

3. **Single-step merge limit**:  
  Each operation produce at most one new large number.  

**Advantages compared to the standard algorithm**:  
- **Faster computation**: Larger formations (e.g., free10w, 4442ff and above) achieve over 10× speedup.  
- **Memory optimization**: Peak memory usage reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Up to 100× speedup under memory constraints.  
- **Storage efficiency**: Smaller intermediate files (space savings increase with table size); book files require no compression.  

**Usage limitations**:  
- Designed specifically for extremely large formations, not suitable for small formations like L3 or T (may perform worse).  
- Pruning reduces success rate accuracy. Accuracy loss increases with deviations from optimal paths, higher endgame difficulty, and stricter formations constraints. Typical loss is within 0.01%, with no impact on optimal paths.  
- **opt only** and **compress** options are unsupported.  

Using this algorithm, free12w-2048 was successfully computed on a 9950x 128GB RAM computer in ~15 days.

To fully utilize the AI's performance, the following tables need to be computed:
   - **free12w-2048**
   - **free11w-2048**
   - **4442f-2048**
   - **free11w-512**

Ensure these tables can be properly loaded in the **Practise** before running the AI. As these tables require significant disk space, to minimize storage usage, it is recommended to:
   - Set a higher **success rate threshold (Remove boards with a success rate below)** for the first three tables. The program allows modifying this parameter during computation to apply different thresholds for different endgame stages.
   - Delete files numbered after half of the target value. For example, delete files from `free11w_2048_1024b` to `free11w_2048_1049b`.
   - Enable advanced algorithm.

## 7.2 AI Testing

Basic programming knowledge is required. Run AItest.py separately, where the `run_test` function writes single-test gameplay records to a specified path.
Record reading method:
```
import numpy as np

rec=np.fromfile(r"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\record\0", dtype='uint64,uint32,uint8')

def decode(encoded_board: np.uint64) -> np.ndarray:
    encoded_board = np.uint64(encoded_board)
    board = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=np.int32)
    for i in range(3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(3, -1, -1):
            encoded_num = (encoded_board >> np.uint64(4 * ((3 - i) * 4 + (3 - j)))) & np.uint64(0xF)
            if encoded_num > 0:
                board[i, j] = 2 ** encoded_num
            else:
                board[i, j] = 0
    return board

for board,score,operator in rec[:]:
    print()
    print(hex(board))
    print(decode(board))
    print({0:'AI',1:'free12',2:'free11_2k',3:'4442f',4:'free11_512'}[operator],'  ',score)
```

# 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why does the software take a long time to start?
**A1**: It requires JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation. JIT compilation improves program performance, but it results in longer initialization times when using various features for the first time.

### Q2: How to optimize the disk space occupied by the table file?
**A2**: Consider enabling the following options to reduce disk usage:
1. **Compress Temp Files**: Compress all intermediate files to reduce disk usage during calculation.
2. **Keep Only Optimal Branches**: Delete all non-optimal moves and keep only the best branches to further reduce disk space.

### Q3: How to resolve high memory usage during computation?
**A3**: The high memory usage during computation is due to storing a large amount of endgame data. It is recommended to increase your system memory or configure virtual memory.

### Q4: Does the computation support resuming from a breakpoint?
**A4**: Yes, table computation supports resuming from a breakpoint. For less experienced users, it is recommended to keep all options and parameters the same when reconnecting.
For experienced users, some parameters can be adjusted based on the calculation stage to achieve more flexible goals, including compressing table files that were not compressed earlier.

### Q5: How to handle errors during computation?
**A5**: If you encounter an error during computation, follow these steps:
1. **Try reconnecting**: Close all windows and restart the program to resume computation.
2. **Check file size trends**: If the issue persists, check the file size trends to identify any anomalies.
3. **Delete recent files**: Delete a few recent files and try reconnecting.
4. **Check error logs**: If the issue still exists, check the `logger.txt` file for error logs.
5. **Contact the Author**: If the above methods do not resolve the issue, it is recommended to contact the author, providing the formation you calculated and the specific situation you encountered. The author will assist you in further troubleshooting and resolving the issue.

### Q6: How to handle disk I/O hang-ups during computation?
**A6**: If there is a hang-up during computation, particularly when using external hard drives, try the following:
1. Manually copy a small file to the hard drive to activate the write operation.
2. If the issue persists, check the external hard drive connection or try a different connection method.

### Q7: Why is the AI's performance lower than expected?
**A7**: If the AI's performance is not as expected, it may be due to the following reasons:
1. **No table computed**: The AI relies on pre-computed tables. Make sure the related tables are available.
2. **Table path changed**: If the table file was moved, reset its path in the Practise interface.
3. **Insufficient computer performance**: If the computer's performance is low, the AI's search speed may be slow, so please be patient.

### Q8: Why do the numbers on the board appear too large, causing distortion?
**A8**: The font size is affected by the display resolution, which in turn affects the board layout. You can adjust the font size in the settings.
