In the standard 2048 game, the goal is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid by sliding them in four directions (up, down, left, right) to create larger tiles. However, in the "no-x" variant — for example, "no-2048" — you intentionally avoid forming that target tile. If you accidentally merge tiles to create it (e.g., combining two 1024 tiles to make 2048), the game ends immediately. Instead, your objective is to score as many points as possible by merging other tiles while carefully managing the board to prevent the forbidden tile from appearing. This requires strategic moves to keep high-value tiles separate and prioritize smaller merges for higher cumulative scores.
